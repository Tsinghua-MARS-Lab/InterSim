## Usage

```javascript
var gutil = require('gulp-util');

gutil.log("stuff happened", "Really it did", gulp.colors.cyan("123"));
gutil.beep();

gutil.replaceExtension("file.coffee", ".js"); // file.js

var opt = {
  name: "todd",
  file: someGulpFile
};
gutil.template("test <%= name %> <%= file.path %>", opt) // test todd /js/hi.js
```

### log(msg...)

Logs stuff. Already prefixed with [gulp] and all that. Use the right colors for values. If you pass in multiple arguments it will join them by a space.

```
values (files, module names, etc.) = magenta
numbers (times, counts, etc) = cyan
```

### colors

This is an instance of [chalk](https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk)

### replaceExtension(path, newExtension)

Replaces a file extension in a path. Returns the new path.

### template(string[, data])

This is a lodash.template function wrapper. You must pass in a valid gulp file object so it is available to the user or it will error. You can not configure any of the delimiters. Look at the [lodash docs](http://lodash.com/docs#template) for more info.

## new File(obj)

path and base attributes are required. Other attributes are stat, cwd, contents. The relative attribute is read-only and is based on the base+path relativity.

```javascript
var file = new gulp.File({
  base: join(__dirname, "./fixtures/"),
  cwd: __dirname,
  path: join(__dirname, "./fixtures/test.coffee")
});
```
